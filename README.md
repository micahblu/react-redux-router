# react-redux-router

An incredibly simple and easy to use router for react redux apps

This repo is experimental! Collaborators are welcome.

## Why
Getting a simple router to work with react and redux is unecessarily painful. The defacto router React router is very fragmented in its api, documentation and support. I was dismayed to be unable to get a simple working demo with the new react-router-redux 5.0.0-alpha.6 using the given example. They listed in the README the need for someone to provide a working demo, but after reporting the issues they were quickly dismissed and the issue closed. I was told to post my issues to stack overflow which, I did but apparently no one understands the new api changes and was unable to get it working. The alternatives to react router fared not much better. There's got to be a better way. My intention is to get a community driven effort here to build something we can all agree on and be extrememly careful and hesistant with api changes
